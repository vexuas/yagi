As this is a player-driven raid, the source of data is also [player-driven](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/tUL0-Nn3Jx7e6uX3k4_yifQ/htmlview?pru=AAABetvDVTc*CUO1z4a8sJgbuqturEfCGQ#). Yagi is not intended to be a replacement; rather to offer a convenient way to players in getting this data. Shoutout to the Olympus world boss leads in working hard and keeping the sheet up-to-date.

I started this project back in late 2018 not only because I was lazy in always opening a new browser tab and checking a spreadsheet but primarily more to learn Javascript and kickstart my passion in frontend development. And with how I did manage to start a career in this field, I like to think that Yagi in all of its spaghetti code and voodoo in its earlier days played a big part of that. This project will always have a special place in my heart and to whoever is reading this and using Yagi, thanks a lot I really appreciate it! (◕ᴗ◕✿)
